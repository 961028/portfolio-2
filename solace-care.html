    <h1>Solace Care Redesign</h1>

    <p>
      Solace Care is a planning and coordination tool for people who have recently lost someone. This redesign focuses
      on clarity, emotional accessibility, and lower cognitive load through a simpler and more focused interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Design goals</h2>

    <p>
      This redesign focuses on reducing mental effort, embedding AI support directly into tasks, and making shared
      planning easier.
    </p>

    <small class="image-description">Original checklist layout with time-based task grouping and category
      filters.</small>

        alt="Original Solace Care home page showing support overview with task cards and AI assistant entry points"
        loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <small class="image-description">Original Solace Care home page with multiple entry points for support and AI
      assistance.</small>

    <h2>Opportunities for improvement</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The original interface presents too many competing elements at once, increasing cognitive load.</li>
      <li>AI assistance is key to the platform, but it is separate from the primary task flow.</li>
      <li>Collaboration features are very limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="image-frame">
      <img src="images-solace-care/checklist-open.png"
        alt="Redesigned checklist view with the new 'Första dagarna' and 'Första veckorna' sections open"
        loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <small class="image-description">Redesigned checklist view with expanded sections for the first days and weeks after
      a loss.</small>

    <h2>Redesigned checklist structure</h2>

    <p>
      The redesigned checklist keeps the original timeline structure but adds a dedicated section for the first days
      after a loss. The home page was removed to simplify navigation and make the checklist the primary entry point.
    </p>

    <div class="image-frame">
      <img src="images-solace-care/checklistitem-page.png"

    </div>
    <small class="image-description">
      Checklist item layout combining task guidance, shared notes, and in-context AI assistance.
    </small>

    <h2>Collaboration and AI integration</h2>

    <p>
      A shared notes panel was added to each checklist item to enable in-context collaboration. This allows co-planners
      to communicate directly within tasks instead of relying on external tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      The AI assistant is now available as a persistent chat panel across all pages. This replaces the previous separate
      view and floating action button, enabling context-aware support inside the active workspace.
    </p>

    <p>
      The AI assistant was extended to reference not only articles and checklist items, but also user-uploaded
      documents.
    </p>

    </div>
    <small class="image-description">Example of the AI assistant responding directly inside an active checklist
      task.</small>

    <h2>Reducing cognitive load</h2>

    <p>
      The interface was simplified to focus on what users need most. Unnecessary elements were removed to reduce
      distraction and make the experience easier to navigate.

    <small class="image-description">Library view organizing support content, recommended reading, and a new search
      feature.</small>

    <h2>Document management</h2>

    <p>
      A dedicated documents page was added to provide an overview of important files. Previously, users had
      to navigate to a different area of the site to access documents uploaded by co-planners or the deceased.
