    <h1>Solace Care Redesign</h1>

    <p>
    Solace Care is a planning and coordination tool for people who have recently lost a close relative.
    This redesign focuses on reducing complexity, improving clarity, and supporting emotionally sensitive users through calm interaction patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Design goals</h2>

    <p>
    The project is guided by three core principles: low cognitive load,
    context-aware AI integration, and simple collaboration.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems with the existing product</h2>

    <p>
    The current interface is visually cluttered, resulting in a high cognitive load.
    Although the platform aims to support AI assistance and collaborative planning,
    both features are poorly integrated.

    <h2>Design approach</h2>

    <p>
    The redesigned checklist keeps the original timeline structure but introduces a new section dedicated to the very first days after a loss.
    By separating these immediate tasks from those that come in the following weeks, it helps users focus on what needs attention right now without being overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done in the following weeks.
    In addition, toggles for hiding checked items and tasks assigned to others have been added.

    </small>

    <p>
    A shared notes panel has been added to every checklist item page to support collaboration directly within the planning process.
    Co-planners can leave a note where it is most relevant,
    rather than relying on external tools.
    </p>

    <p>
    The AI assistant has been integrated as a persistent chat panel across all pages
    instead of being isolated on a separate view or hidden behind a floating action button.
    This allows the AI to respond based on the user's current context, directly in their active workspace.

    <p>
    The overall interface has been reduced to core functionality only.
    Visual elements and content have been deliberately simplified to minimise distraction
    and maintain a low cognitive load, which is especially important for the target group.

    <p>
    Finally, a documents page has been added to provide a clear overview of all important files in one place.
    Currently, the user has to navigate to a separate part of the platform to access documents,
    uploaded by other planners or by the deceased while they were still alive.
