				Solace Care Redesign
			</h1>
			<p>
				Solace Care is a planning and coordination tool for people who
				have recently lost someone. This redesign focuses on reducing
				mental effort, integrating AI more deeply, and making shared
				planning easier.
			</p>

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Original checklist layout with time-based task grouping and
				category filters.

					alt="Original Solace Care home page showing support overview with task cards and AI assistant entry points"
					loading="lazy"

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Original Solace Care home page with multiple entry points for
				support and AI assistance.
			</small>

			<h2>Opportunities for improvement</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The original interface presents too many competing elements
					at once, increasing cognitive load.
				</li>
				<li>
					AI assistance is key to the platform, but it is separate
					from the primary task flow.
				</li>
				<li>Collaboration features are very limited.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="image-frame">
				<img
					src="images-solace-care/checklist-open.png"
					alt="Redesigned checklist view with the new 'Första dagarna' and 'Första veckorna' sections open"

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Redesigned checklist view with expanded sections for the first
				days and weeks after a loss.
			</small>

			<h2>Redesigned checklist structure</h2>
			<p>
				The redesigned checklist keeps the original timeline structure
				but adds a dedicated section for the first days after a loss.
				The home page was removed to simplify navigation and make the
				checklist the primary entry point.
			</p>

			<div class="image-frame">
				<img
					src="images-solace-care/checklistitem-page.png"
					alt="Redesigned checklist item page showing task instructions, shared notes panel, and navigation controls"

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Checklist item layout combining task guidance, shared notes, and
				in-context AI assistance.
			</small>

			<h2>Collaboration and AI integration</h2>
			<p>
				A shared notes panel was added to each checklist item to enable
				in-context collaboration. This allows co-planners to communicate
				directly within tasks instead of relying on external tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				The AI assistant is now available as a persistent chat panel
				across all pages. This replaces the previous separate view and
				floating action button, enabling context-aware support inside
				the active workspace.
			</p>
			<p>
				The AI assistant was extended to reference not only articles and
				checklist items, but also user-uploaded documents.
			</p>

			</div>

				active checklist task.

			<h2>Reducing cognitive load</h2>
			<p>
				The interface was simplified to focus on what users need most.
				Unnecessary elements were removed to reduce distraction and make
				the experience easier to navigate.
			</p>

			<div class="image-frame">
				<img
					src="images-solace-care/library.png"

			</div>
			<small class="image-description">
				Library view organizing support content, recommended reading,
				and a new search feature.
			</small>

			<h2>Document management</h2>
			<p>
				A dedicated documents page was added to provide an overview of
				important files. Previously, users had to navigate to a
				different area of the site to access documents uploaded by
				co-planners or the deceased.
			</p>

			<div class="image-frame">
				<img
					src="images-solace-care/documents.png"
