    <h1>Solace Care Redesign</h1>

    <p>
    Solace Care is a planning and coordination tool for people who have recently lost a close relative.
    This redesign focuses on reducing complexity, improving clarity, and supporting emotionally sensitive users through calmer interaction patterns.
    </p>

    <h2>Design goals</h2>

    <p>
    The project is guided by four core principles: clear and predictable navigation, low cognitive load,
    context-aware AI integration, and efficient collaboration between multiple users.
    </p>

    <h2>Problems with the existing product</h2>

    <p>
    The current interface is visually cluttered and difficult to navigate.
    Although the platform aims to support AI assistance and collaborative planning,
    both features are poorly integrated and provide limited practical value.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    The existing AI solution lacks contextual awareness.
    Since it cannot see what the user is currently viewing, users are forced to manually explain their situation
    instead of asking simple, relevant questions. This increases friction and cognitive effort.
    </p>

        Inside each checkbox-item is a text-guide, collaboration tools, and context aware AI.
    </small>

    <h2>Design approach</h2>

    <p>
    To address this, the AI assistant has been integrated as a persistent chat panel across all pages
    instead of being isolated on a separate view or hidden behind a floating action button.
    This allows the AI to respond based on the user's current context and active workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
    A shared notes panel has also been added to every page to support collaboration directly within the planning process.
    Co-planners can leave and access relevant information exactly where it is needed,
    rather than relying on external tools or disconnected views.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    The overall interface has been reduced to core functionality only.
    Visual elements and content have been deliberately simplified to minimise distraction
    and maintain a low cognitive load, which is especially important for the target group.
