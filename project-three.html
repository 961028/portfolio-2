    <h1>Zalando's landing page</h1>

    <p>Zalando's landing page serves as the site's only gender-neutral entry point and is primarily designed to guide users toward a category choice.
        This redesign focuses on improving clarity and orientation for first-time visitors without changing the page's original purpose.</p>

    <h2>Carousel</h2>
    <p>The carousel hides useful information and limits readability. It is replaced with static content blocks with clear hierarchy.</p>

    <h2>Promotional Banner</h2>
    <p>The banner was made slightly bigger and bolder, and the wording was changed to speak directly to the user.</p>

    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>Alignment issues between "Kläder" and "Kvinna" were corrected. The logo was enlarged, spacing adjusted, and the search field made clearer.</p>
    
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>"Outlet" appeared active despite not being selected. This false state was removed, and Outlet is shown as page content instead of an active navigation item.</p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>Categories hidden on the landing page but available elsewhere on the site are added as page content. This provides more opportunity for exploration without increasing coginitive load.</p>
