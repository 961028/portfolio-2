				UX Research: Browser Window Saving
			</h1>
			<p>
				This masters thesis investigates how browsers can better support
				multi-session web tasks, meaning tasks that span multiple
				browsing sessions over time, by analysing existing window-saving
				solutions, identifying user needs through task analysis and
				interviews, and designing and evaluating prototype interfaces in
				direct comparison with existing workspace implementations in
				Microsoft Edge and Vivaldi to assess usability improvements.

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				Most modern browsers have until recently (at the time of the
				study) lacked a native window-saving feature, leading many users
				to rely on session persistence, extensions, or manual
				workarounds to save their tabs.
			</p>

			<h2>Research foundation</h2>
			<p>
				The design direction was informed by a competitive audit of
				existing browser workspace implementations, task analysis of
				save and restore workflows, and interviews focused on how users
				manage multi-session browsing tasks.
			</p>

			<h2>Usability evaluation</h2>
			<p>
				The concept was evaluated through a comparative usability study
				against existing browser workspace implementations. Results
				showed statistically significant improvements for several tasks
				in ease of use, task efficiency, and user confidence when saving
				and restoring windows compared to comparison baselines Microsoft
				Edge and Vivaldi.

				Average Likert Ratings (Excluding Task 5 and SUS):<br />
				Likert scale ratings revealed significant differences between
				the research prototypes and both Microsoft Edge and Vivaldi.
			</small>

			<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
			<p>
				Microsoft Edge now exposes “Save tabs to a workspace” directly
				in its “New” dropdown, giving window saving equal prominence to
				workspace creation which reflects the study's recommendation to
				prioritise explicit save actions.
